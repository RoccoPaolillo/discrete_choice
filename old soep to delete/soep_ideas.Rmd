# Procedure

* All people in the household are eligible of personal interview, prospectively and retrospectively on employment, partnership and fertility histories etc.  [@longhi2014]
* *active panel*: set of repondents  in a particular year, considering refresher samples to keep the sample representative of German population (demographic inflows) [@soep_sample]
* Reason to leave:
  - death, moving abroad
  - attritors: definitive final refusal
* *active panel*:
  * information on household: asked the household head [@longhi2014;@soep_sample;@soep_quest]
    + individual questionnaire - pl dataset
    + household questionnaire - hl dataset
  * proxy information:
    + children below 10 years
    + person deceased for their last period
  * personal interview:
    + age 11+ : interviewed themselves if parent consent
    + adults : interviewed themselves
* People who participated in the first wave and descendants are asked to participate as long as they live in Germany.  [@longhi2014]
* yearly, some topics even more than one year. Not all topic every year [@soep_topic]
* only random probability sample: at national level sample points sampled by federal state and municipality level, then stratfied by locals and migrants. Use of weights see [@goebel2019] (see weights in @longhi2014)

# Structure

Family of studies [@soep_intro]:

* CORE
* Innovation sample SOEP-IS: from "Innovation" and "Innovation and Incentivisation", accepting ideas from people outside DIW, with an exclusive usage of data for one year
* Related Studies SOEP-RS: other ventures that can be used for comparison (e.g. BASE II for elder people). FiD: Evaluation of family policies in Germany, part of SOEP from v31  [@goebel2019]. 

Levels:

* individual level: members of family +16 years, life-course event approach from "cradle grave"
* household level
* regional data with local information: privacy, contract and specific institution

Dataset:

* pl: individual questionnaire on civil participation, lifestyle and work...
* hl: household info, can contain info on education/activities of young people born before 2002
* biol: first time: present life up to present day
* bioparent: first time: info on their parents
* bioagel (proxy questions under 10 asked to parents):
  + A first after childbirth for mother, related to nurtiring etc.
  + B after the child is 2 to 3 years for mother, ability of child etc.
  + C child 5 to 6 years for mother, ability of child etc.
  + D child 7 to 8 both parents parenting goals, child aspiration and achievement
  + E child 9 to 10 by mother, education and leisure time of child
* biopupil, children born on 2002 or later:
  + 11-12 first when aged 11: friends and social network
  + 13-14 early youth, idem + what allowed to do alone and political interests
* jugendl: until 17 y/o, introduced in 2001: youth questionnaire, personality, social networks, side jobs etc.
\par
  older than 17 y/o: as for all adults
* plueckel (adults + 17 yo): for the years they did not take part
* abroad: 2008-2010 and 2013-2014: Germans who moved abroad, while they were abroad. Only these years
* vpl: on the person that passed away

Data Structure and Naming Conventions [@soep_struct]:

* name of datasets: combination of unit, type, format, questionnaires or module
  + Unit
    + h*: household level
    + p*: individual level
  + Type of data
    + tracking: survey units, good to identify the research population. *brutto: who did not provide interview
    + original: unprocess info from interview
    + generated: *gen, improved quality, pequiv: armonized for international comparison.
    + biography: generated dataset from biological perspective (life course): bio*. All at individual level
    + survey: household

* Dataset Format [@soep_struct]:
  + Wide Format: ppath, phrf, hpath, hhrf. One row per survey unit
  + Long Format: biogrpahical dataset, *l, person-year combination (see @field2012)
  + Spell format: spells for event-history analysis, marriage and couple
  
SOEPlong format provides the info pooled and harmonized (e.g. income prior to 2001 in Euros)

* Data Name:
  + Long format and not generated: DVTxxxx see Fig.\ref{fig:datname}
    + D: dataset identifier: p:person, h:household, l:bibliography, j:youth
    + V: variable identifier: l: numeric, a:alphanumeric
    + T: topic identifier
    + xxx: digit
    + _v/_h: versioning or harmined
  + Generated variables: intuitive names. See Fig.\ref{fig:soepmiss} for missing values

* Specific:
  + lela: retrospective biography information

* SOEP-Core:
  + files on development of sample
  + generate data
  + orginally surveyed data
  + biography prior to the study (biol?)

Data Identifiers and Pointers [@soep_ident] 

* Identifiers: identify unit surveys (households and individuals) so to let you connect them for nested analysis (individual $\leftrightarrow$ household):
  + HID: household, CID: first house where they lived
  + PID: person
  + All dataset individual level have both HID + PID + syear for panel data
  + INTID: interviewer
  + VPID: deceased person (whose info the participant give) 
  
* Pointers: combine information on different persons, link the PID to other people in the dataset:
  + PARID ppathl: partner in the year
  + KIDNRxx biobirth: identify the kids, points the mother to the children, assuming biological mother and that partner of mother can change (and father is one partner of the mother)
  + underage children: K_PMUM kidl child $\rightarrow$ mother, K_PMUMP kidl child $\rightarrow$ partner of the mother
  + adults (+ 17 yo): participant ID $\rightarrow$ parent: bioparen MNR:mother, FNR:partner of mother
  + to siblings: SIBPNRxx biosib
  + to twins: PNR-twin/trip/quad
  
You will always merge datasets on the shape:\par
$Main Dataset (ID-y dep.) + Auxiliary Dataset (Pointer-x ind.)= Merged dataset by ID-Pointer$

# Strategy

Possible strategies will be to identify attitude variables PID of house holder to link with household level HID. To check if at HID  there are info on neighborhood of HID (reported by house holder), or check regional data we have. CID in next steps to trace change in residential choice through generations. Comparing PID level between generations (Identifier for parents) to study change in preferences/values and CID level - HID level (original household - current household) for change of neighborhood through generations 

## Variables

**[companion_soep](http://companion.soep.de/)**, annually: all years, otherwise it is reported


Neighborhood: Home Amenities > neighborhood amenities, 
    
Individual: Attitudes, Values, Personality > political orientation
